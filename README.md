# Job Future

### About: 
This is a web app designed for CODE (Canadian Open Data Exchange), which is a national hackathon. It aims to empower the youth of today by allowing them access to job projections and trends. Simply seach the title of the job your interested in and see the results.

Job Future uses the models of the Canadian Occupational Projection System (COPS) and the National Occupational Classification (NOC, 2006 version) to develop projections of future trends in the numbers of job openings and job seekers by occupation at the national level.
